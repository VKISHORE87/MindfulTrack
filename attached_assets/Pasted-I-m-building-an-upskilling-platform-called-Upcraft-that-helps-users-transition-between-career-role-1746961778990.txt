I'm building an upskilling platform called "Upcraft" that helps users transition between career roles. I need to implement a feature that displays detailed role transition templates when a user selects their current role and target role in the Career Options tab.

When a user selects both roles and clicks "Save as Target Role", I want to display the appropriate transition template from the following database. The template should show:
1. The transition path (step-by-step roles to progress through)
2. Typical transition timeframe
3. Key skills to acquire

Here's the database of role transition templates I need to implement:

// TECHNICAL/IT ROLE TRANSITIONS
