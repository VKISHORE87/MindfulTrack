# Fix Integration Between Career Options and Dashboard Tabs in Upcraft App

## Current Issues:
1. The dashboard page doesn't reflect "Artificial Intelligence Engineer" as the target role even after it's selected and saved in the Career Options tab
2. The Practice tab needs to be removed without impacting other application components

## Required Changes:

### 1. Fix Role Integration Between Tabs
- Update the state management to ensure that when a user selects and saves a target role in the Career Options tab (e.g., "Artificial Intelligence Engineer"), it updates throughout the application, especially on the Dashboard
- Implement proper state propagation between components
- Ensure the Career Roadmap, Skill Radar Chart, and all relevant progress indicators reflect the selected target role

### 2. Remove Practice Tab
- Remove the Practice tab from the navigation sidebar
- Update the routing to handle the absence of this tab
- Ensure all navigation links work properly after removal
- Maintain proper styling and layout integrity of the remaining tabs

### 3. Application Structure Considerations
- The application appears to have React-based architecture with multiple components
- Make sure to update component states and props correctly
- Check for any localStorage or state management systems (Redux, Context API, etc.) that might need updating
- Ensure proper data flow between Career Options and Dashboard components

### 4. Component Updates
For Dashboard updates, ensure these elements reflect the correct target role:
- Target Role display in the header
- Skill validation progress (1/10)
- Skill gaps (Programming, System Design, etc.)
- Career progress radar chart
- 12-month roadmap

### 5. Data Consistency
- Make sure all references to the target role are consistent across all views
- Update any related metrics or progress indicators to match the selected role

## Code Focus Areas:
- State management functions
- Component prop passing
- Navigation/routing configuration
- Dashboard data retrieval and display logic
- Career Options save functionality
